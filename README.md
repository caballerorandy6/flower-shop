# The Flower Shop System
___

## Description
The Flower Shop Store is looking to attract as many customers as possible, especially people who are short on time. It is the perfect alternative for people who don't want to or can't spend their time looking for a product in a physical store. The Flower Store offers beautiful flowers at an incredible price and certified quality.

### Usage
Flower Shop Store is an easy-to-use application Following the sequence of prompts that appear on the screen, choosing the desired option, and pressing the "ENTER" key, Flower Shop Store will direct you appropriately and provide you with all the information you need for a simple and quick online shopping experience.

When you begin by creating a new account, Flower Shop Store will guide you through the registration process by asking for all your information. Once this process is complete you will be directed to the main page of the application where you will be able to see all the available products.

### Brief
I have been given the task of developing an online store to sell flowers. The system will manage the sale of flowers to different customers. Customers registered in the store can log in and buy products and get information about their recent order and order history. The system administrator is authorized to create, update and delete products.
